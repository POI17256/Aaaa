# Net_Cracker
___
  A Python script that combines openly available tools such as tcpdump, aircrack-ng, crunch, and the mac airport utility to automate batch wifi password cracking for WEP, WPA, and WPA2 using generic bruteforce and dictionary attack methods (automatic WEP cracking if one is detected).

## Installation:
___
  In order to work, this script requires the Mac airport utility to be on the computer and symlinked into a location in the PATH. In addition to this, tcpdump, aircrack-ng, and crunch must be installed as well.

## DISCLAIMER:
___
  This should ONLY be used for legal purposes such as testing WiFi password strength with the owners permission. Furthermore, this script simply automates the process of switching channels, monitoring the network, capturing packets, and cracking EAPOL/handshake packets. It does this by using already openly available tools and claims no right to their respective source code.
